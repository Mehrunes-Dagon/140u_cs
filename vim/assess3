          2.   Insert two blank lines, followed by the line:
               Question 1: Create directory

               Following this line, insert the bash command to

          3.   Insert two blank lines, followed by the line:
               Question 2: Copy files

               Following this line, insert the SINGLE (one command only) bash command to
               copy the following files to your 'assess3' directory:

                         /home/courses/140u-doug.jones/main.cpp
                         /home/courses/140u-doug.jones/main.h
                         /home/courses/140u-doug.jones/makefile

               Execute this command and copy the files.

          4.   Insert two blank lines, followed by the line:
               Question 3: List directory

               list (in long format) the contents of your 'assess3'
               directory.

               Execute the command, and insert the output of the command
               on the line following the bash command.

          5.   Insert two blank lines, followed by the line:
               Question 4: main.cpp contents

               Following this line, insert the vim command-mode line to read the
               contents of the file
               assess3/main.cpp
               into your file buffer.

               Execute the command, i.e. insert the file contents
               into your message.

          6.   Insert two blank lines, followed by the line:
               Question 5: Move Comments
              
               Following this line, insert the vim command-mode command (single command,
               no command separators)  that will
               move the 4 lines that begin with '//' to the lines
               preceeding the line that begins with '#include', and put
               them in sorted order.

               Execute the command.  The result of your command should be to change
               the contents read in Step (5) to:
               //0.
               //1.  Course:        CS 140U
               //2. Assignment:    Assessment 3
               //3.
               #include "main.h"

          7.   Insert two blank lines, followed by the line:
               Question 6: make command
          
               Following this line, insert the vim command-mode command to
               execute the following bash command:
               make --directory=assess3

               Execute the command, and insert the output of the command in the
               following lines.

          8.   Insert two blank lines, followed by the line:
               Question 7: run program

               Following this line, insert the vim command-mode command to
               execute the following bash command:
               assess3/main

               Execute the command, and insert the output of the command in the
               following lines.

          9.   At this point your email message should be fairly long, and consist
               of a series of 7 questions and their answers.

               Make sure you have followed each step precisely. If you are not satisfied
               that you have composed your email message correctly you should exit vim and
               then exit mailx without sending the email message, and then try it again.

               When you ARE satisfied with your email message, save your file buffer, exit 
               vim, and tranmit the message.  This is your submission. 
         
               You should then start on the next module.
